Deployed app: https://gooogle.firebaseapp.com/

This application was created during a hackathon while I was a student at MakerSquare, a full-time immersive coding bootcamp. I had only learned JavaScript the prior week.
A goal of the hackathon was to learn a new technology. I chose learn about Firebase (aquired by Google) and incorporate it as a backend.

The application draws inspiration from dating websites. Users can specify their preferences for celebrities that they want to "oogle" (men or women; age range). 
Users are then shown pictures of celebrities which meet their criteria. Celebrities who also like the user will show in the "Matches" tab.
