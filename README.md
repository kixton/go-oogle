<h3>About the project</h3>
This application was created during a hackathon while I was a student at MakerSquare, a full-time immersive coding bootcamp. I had only learned JavaScript the prior week.

A goal of the hackathon was to learn a new technology. I chose learn about Firebase (aquired by Google) and incorporate it as a backend.

The application draws inspiration from dating websites. Users first specify their preferences for celebrities that they want to "oogle" (men or women; age range). Users are then shown pictures of celebrities who meet their criteria. Users can select to "Like" or "Dislike" a celebrity. Celebrities who mutually "Like" the user are displayed in the "Matches" tab.
